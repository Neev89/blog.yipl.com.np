      <p>August 22, 2015 was an adventurous day for designers and front end developers in the city mostly because majority of us attended the Kathmandu dribbble meetup at the Entrance Cafe, Pulchowk. With the objective of creating learning and networking platform for designers in Nepal, Kathmandu Dribbble meetup was organized for the first time in Kathmandu. The event had speakers/presenters, design showcases, networking tables among the major attractions. There were five speakers who shared their experiences in design, branding and marketing. So let’s talk about what happened at the Dribbble meetup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Dribbble-blog/Dribbblers-2.jpg" alt="Dribbble" /></p>

<!--more-->

<p>The event started off with Ishu Subedi sharing her experience about how she gradually moved towards web designing. Even though she had a stable career before stepping in web designing, she was not very satisfied with what she did. She wanted to do something that she truly wanted – “DESIGNING”.</p>

<p>“Following the money, a simple mistake that everyone makes” – Ishu Subedi. Well, this time she didn’t think about the money and she finally chose a career that she truly desired.</p>

<p>Talking about design, Amit Bajracharya, a senior graphic designer shared his knowledge about design theory. The basic concepts about C.R.A.P (Contrast. Repetition. Alignment. Proximity) were thoroughly explained in the simplest of ways.</p>

<p>Diveej Shah had a very interesting approach as he talked about advertising and branding. This session was highly influential, mostly because many of us did not know the difference between branding and advertising. Mr. Diveej cleared the confusion with dramatic examples that somehow simplified the basic ideas of branding and advertising.</p>

<p>Bidhan Rajbhandari, Founder of Makeways, spoke on how constant marketing and personal branding are key skills to landing lucrative projects. This entertaining session had every good element to inspire as well.</p>

<p>Ankur Sharma, Co-Founder of Expresiv Studios ended the sessions with his presentation on Human Computer Interaction. His presentation with the word “Nothing” instantly grabbed the audience’s attention.</p>

<p>Panel Discussion followed the presentations and Bidhan Rajbhandari and Ankur Sharma as panelists was another round of amazing. Audience had very interesting questions which were answered very well by the panelists.</p>

<p>What could have been a better end to the meetup if not for the networking, snacks and of course the beer! All in all, the meetup was a success both in terms of content and experience.</p>

<p>Finally, here is what our colleagues at YoungInnovations had to say about the meetup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Dribbble-blog/dribbble-ball.jpg" alt="Dribbble" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was great to be a part of Dribbble Meetup. There were a lot of people who participated in the Meetup. I got a chance to meet and interact with local design communities. It’s a great platform for learning and creating new networks for the designers. I got the chance to learn something new from them. All the speakers gave their presentation in an interesting manner. I enjoyed myself and learned plenty of new things from the presentations. It’s an incredible event. Hopefully I will be a part of this event in the coming years as well.” - <strong>Punya Ruchal</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dribbble meetup featured great presentations. I found the presentation on design principles really informative. Kudos to the organizers.” - <strong>Rakeeb Rajbhandari</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“More people showed up than I expected. It seemed designers were waiting for an event of this kind to happen. Of course, there were similar events such as Graphic Design Meetup happening for the past 2 years. However, this was Dribbble, the Disney Land for designers :)</p>

  <p>As soon as I entered the venue, I was greeted with a goodie bag! The bag had a Dribbble dot grid sketch book, a ball pen, a Bhav yearly planner and a Tee! It’s quite unusual to receive this many swags in a local event in Kathmandu.</p>

  <p>The event started a bit late (an hour late if i remember:) ). There was no lag in between sessions though. There were 5 sessions in total by Ishu, Amit, Diveej Shah,  Bidhan and Ankur.</p>

  <p>None of the sessions seemed lengthy or boring. They were all resourceful, fun and interesting. I specially enjoyed sessions by Ankur, Bidhan and the panel discussion that followed after the presentation sessions. Ankur’s witty presentation (or no presentation) on Human Computer Interaction was something that people will remember for a long time :) Bidhan’s session on “Marketing your design” was both fun and inspiring. He showed why one should choose a career that s/he enjoys doing and is actually good at.</p>

  <p>At the end of the event, there was snacks and free beer! I did not drink though :)</p>

  <p>I congratulate and encourage the organisers to continue Dribbble Meetups in the future. There’s only one suggestion - Please put a raised platform for presentation-screen and speaker so that people at the back can also see what is happening :)” - <strong>Anjan Shrestha</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since it’s been the first meet up related to designs, I was very hopeful to get the knowledge of creative designs, work process and current projects that are affecting us daily and yes I got a chance to witness all that. It was awesome. There were speakers/presenters, design showcases, networking tables etc. I personally think this meetup was great where people shared their experiences, promoted, discovered, and explored the designs. It was fun !  - <strong>Nirajan Basnet</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A meetup that was both educational and inspirational for young designers like us. A lot of new things were shared making the event very lively and enjoyable. Knowledge sharing about how people changed their careers to finally have a strong platform in this sector and information on branding and advertising the products were highly inspirational. - <strong>Rishav Malla</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first ever Kathmandu Dribbble meetup was a great experience for me. I was very excited to see such a good number of people. It was a great platform where we could interact with some of the amazing designers and front end developers. The presentations were interesting where I learned many things related to designs. The event also provided us an opportunity at networking with like minded people. The entire session was very interesting; we received official event t-shirt along with meetup kits from dribbble and to add up to it, they provided us with some good refreshments! I am eagerly waiting for the next meetup. All in all, it was a wonderful Saturday. Thank you Dribbble.” - <strong>Sweta Shrestha</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dribbble Meetup Kathmandu” is the first UX/UI event that I have ever attended. Dribbble Meetup Kathmandu was happening for the first time in Kathmandu so it was fun and inspirational. It was good learning &amp; networking with UX/UI designers”  - <strong>Rohit Shrestha</strong></p>
