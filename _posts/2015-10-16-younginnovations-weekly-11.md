The last week before Dashain holidays had few things to offer. Start of chilly morning and evening and making them even colder was on-and-off drizzles from heaven. Design of our blog has changed for your eyes only. We finished our first to-be-continued Skill Learning Week (SLW).

We are very happy to bring out our new design of our blog as you can see the difference reading this weekly. All the credits for the new look goes to relentless work of Anjan and Sweta. Anjan provided a new perspective to the blog with his awesome imagination and wonderful cover images for each blog post. Sweta with her prowess in front-end made his imagination come to reality. Hats off guys! The blog looks awesome. 

Last week, Prashant-led first SLW had to be continued last wednesday. He shared how to use trello appropriately to create issue and maintain it using different columns. He showed us the relationship between git flow and issue flow for better output in our work. Our decision to start SLW was perfect to learn new topics to improve our work and personality as well. Since we have holidays next week, upcoming SLW will be held when we come back to work.

Although there is a scarcity of petroleum products and because of which we are going to have some trouble, let's make up with what we have and enjoy Dashain with our family and friends. Let the best season of the year bring out best in us. Happy Dashain folks!
