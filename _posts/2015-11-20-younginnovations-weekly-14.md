Between the continuous struggle of fuel, gas and oil, we managed to celebrate tihar with all respect, blessings, lights, singing and dancing. Though in scarcity, I must say we gave life to our culture. Well, returing from the short holiday of tihar, we at yipl had fantastic week as we always have.Starting from the anouncement of our very own Mr. Anjan Shrestha dai, who also happens to be our V.P, Product innovations, that he will be doing SLW (Skill Learning Wednesday) on Pixate (a prototyping tool).

Personally speaking, my heartbeat increased at the very moment of that anouncement with excitement. We had been hearing and viewing demo made by Anjan dai from about a month. We, frontenders had seen what pixate would produce but we were totally unaware about how things work in so called pixate. But it really was like a delicious cake we would see in bakery shop. 

Well, finally wednesday arrived with mail on our gmail account with an asset file which would be used to make a small webpage during the SLW session. We all installed pixate studio from official website of pixate which is http://www.pixate.com/".For those who just heard of pixate for the first time, I would like to give brief description of it. Yeah, Pixate is a prototyping tool, by that we mean its a tool which lets you create a modal of your product which you could use to show to your clients. And with pixate one can also include animations and other interactions just as one would have with real product (website or web appllication) and also,one can experiment it on mobile device. There are some other prototyping tools as well like principle, proto.io, origami, framer, flinto for mac and much more. Anjan dai says he likes pixate and principle. Anyways, we installed, connected pixate to our mobile device and waited for clock to tick 4 pm and then the SLW session started. All members of this SLW which included frontend developers and three other enthusiasts from backend develoment team followed instructions of our presentor and ended up making a prototype webpage which could be viewed on our mobile. How interesting is that!!  

The most interesting thing I would say was to see the quick change on mobile as soon as we make change on prototype on our laptop. Its obviously not possible to explain all that we learned on the session. Point in short, we really enjoyed the session with such a creative and enthusiastic learner of our team. It was really very intersting and knowledge boosting session.But, because I had to catch or wait for a local vehicle to reach my home, which if i would be unable to do would create a problem for me reaching my home I had to leave the session little sooner. 

I really am upset with the fuel crisis which is now leading to shortage of other crucial things like medicine, rise in price of almost everything from bus fair to food materials. Little relief is that some fortunates are getting half cylinder of cooking gas all after staying in queue for days and cold nights. I really hope corruption to end and this crisis to vanish from our country as soon as possible. Long live knowlege and innovations. Long live yipl. Continue following our blog because more interesting stuffs are coming.
