On April 25, 2015, earthquake of magnitude 7.8 struck Nepal that destroyed millions of home and thousands of people lost their lives. It became one of the destructive events in Nepalese history after 1934 A.D. earthquake.  The constant aftershocks and two major quakes had left Nepalese people in deep sorrow. The earthquake killed more than 8,960 and injured more than twice as many. Many historic buildings were collapsed, one of the greatest historic building “Dharahara” was turned down in pile of mud and debris. More than 600,000 people were displaced form their home.

After few hour of the incident, rescue teams and volunteer from national and international relief teams  reached to the affected parts. Different kinds of donation were appealed by various organizations and people throughout the world. The relief was coming from every corner of the world. But the problem was, we didn't have any kind of tracking system to record how much aid was pledged or distributed. 

Nepal Earthquake Relief and Humanitarian aid monitoring system was developed to track and monitor flow of aid for earthquake relief and humanitarian aid in Nepal. The main objective of this system is to ensure relief funds and resources reaches to the targeted beneficiaries. The transparency of funds in an open and accessible manner is perhaps the first step to ensure effective mobilization of resources. Right now, the system only focuses on the single transactions such as donor providing aid to recipient organizations. But we still need more information on how receiver organization spend the aid on their respective district and sector of focus.
 
How does the system works?

* These data are manually monitored and entered into the system from different sources such as [Financial Tracking Services](https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyDetails&appealID=1100), [US Chamber Foundation](http://www.uschamberfoundation.org/corporate-citizenship-center/nepal-earthquake-corporate-aid-tracker),[Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund](http://pmrelief.opmcm.gov.np/contributors.aspx),[Onlinekhabar](http://www.onlinekhabar.com/),[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake).
* People visiting the system can provide their feedback for individual instances of relief aid and could also report on missing elements.
* Organizations and individuals providing relief aid (both as the main source and as intermediary) can submit their aid directly into the system by filling up a simple form. 
* The system allows anyone aware of relief aid can submit the information as primary sources. Submitted information is verified by our team in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
