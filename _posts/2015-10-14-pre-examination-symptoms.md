It's no wonder that we have gone through so many examinations in our learning period, where we strive to get an academic degree. Before each and every examination, most of us (assuming all of us) do go through some funny cycles that include changes in the physical and mental behaviour. Some might notice the things, but most of us are unaware of the fact that something does go on at the onset of any examination. More the gravity of examination more it sounds resonable. The chain of cycles presented here have hold true for me, and my target is to gather how much of a coincidence will it be with all the people who took part in the presentation session and reading it right now.

The whole slides have been divided into number of topics, which are covered as follows : 


### The Scenerio

The scenerio picks up before say 15 days ahead of an actual examination. Since there is still 15 days left for an exam, one can end up saying, hmmm, got enough time to read and practice so gets first few days wasted by moving here and there. Well if it were possible one might actually visit his/her distant home during the time. After all **15 days** is much just to study right ? 

### Worse gets Better, Better gets splendid

So you think you had hated all those tv serials, like, Kasauti Zindagi Ki, Kyuki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, well guess what ? Those hated tv serials and all the things that you have discarded surfaces as being better than ever. And to your great surprise all those your favourite movies (for me The Matrix, Terminator : The Judgement Day) if pops up on the television screen, you'll notice that its more worthwhile to watch than ever, even though you know every nooks and corners of the movie. 

Yup, it happens when you are up for an examination.

### Bowel Movement

You have now officially discarded 5-6 days and now you get serious. But whenever you try to open up your book/text book to read, you can hear your stomach growling. Yup thats the sound of the hunger, and to your surprise there's no one at home to cook for you. But not to worry as you now get all the energy to be the cook of the day, and yes reading can be done later, as there are enough days to spare for study, isn't it ?

### Water Bottle Required/Input-Output Effect

Since reading is a very thirsty process, you need to have a water bottle at your side always right ? And when the input is water ...... the output is indeed ...... **obvious**.

### Solar System Effect

Well when you get much serious for an exam, you'll be having textbooks/guess papers/question banks/course book/water bottle and whatever relevent(you think so) lying all around you. Now I proudly present you the solar system, where you are the sun and the things lying around are none other than the planets.

### Counting Pages

This is my favourite one. When in reading mode, we end up counting the pages so that we know how much more is left to study. Don't know why we do this, but we do this anyhow.

### Sleep 

Everytime exam is at the corner, you'll end up having a very sound sleep. You'll be sleeping like a baby. The course books and those text books work miraculously, there is no need for the sleeping pills as the lessons to cover for exam would work just fine.

### The Alarm Clock

As the curtain draws towards the day of examination, drastic measures have to be taken. What good is a way, than relying on your favourite alarm clock. You set up the alarm early in the morning, and to your surprise it rings at the precise time. You wake up and  check out through the window, end up making decision of sleeping 15 minutes more, but, surprise, surprise, you wake up after 2 hours. And indeed you did everything in your power to wake up in time, but what can you do when alarm forgets you, right ?

### Guess The Loop

Presented here is an infinite loop, that never terminates. You'll most oftenly face this situation when you try to read through a sentence, but to your surprise you cannot just move ahead of the sentence even though the sentence is as simple as "The Sun Rises from the east.". You keep on repeating the sentences again and again and again yet you are at the same sentence. Now its official, your brain has gone to an overload state and it is having trouble comprehending what it just read.

### Rush Hour

Yup, tomorrow is the big day. Need to get through all the stuffs to read. But why should you read all the topics for there are question banks, guess papers to read. You end up reading what teacher had told you to be important and guessing (with certainty) that some of the questions won't pop up in the upcoming exam, as it was already asked last semester. 

Finally, you are ready for an exam, well thats what you think.

### Outcome

Outcome is plain obvious isn't it ?
